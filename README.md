# Cyber-security static table on two dimensional array with javascript
 Decided to create a good project that will help the community to have an indepth knowledge on how to  use "for loop" on javascript.however,this project  will go a long way for anyone who's interested to understand how looping works also making use of  it effectively.
NOTE: Create your own template on html to be able to output your work and you can style it if you want.
in addition to that,being able to understand how to use a for loop to iterate and level down a two dimensional array,that knowledge or experience can been used to iterate class,object,form validation,set time out, set time interval and 
alot of other great task/project.although it ain't gonna be so easy to comprehend at once.please my dm is open for any questions or guilds that will help me to sharpen my JavaScript skills more efficiently
